# Essentia Network White Paper

### Version 0.6.0 ‚Äî **DRAFT FOR INTERNAL REVIEW**

_(Supersedes v0.5.0; Society-of-Renewal alignment, governance norms, privacy, and civic-cost specifications consolidated as of 29 Oct 2025)_

---

## Changelog (v0.5.0 ‚Üí v0.6.0)

- **Scope pivot:** Essentia defined as a **post-quantum civic ledger** aligned to the Society of Renewal (identity, attestations, governance, UBI rails), not a general-purpose L1.
- **Identity:** Introduced **Person (DID)** with passkeys + social recovery; claims as verifiable credentials with selective disclosure.
- **Value rails:** Added **Essential Unit (ùí∞)** for UBI (non-transferable, expiring, indexed) alongside **Essent (‚Ñ∞)** for contribution rewards; separated issuance streams.
- **Governance (normative):** Private ballots with public proofs; **RCV**, **revocable delegation** (domain-scoped), **QV for budgeting only**; eligibility snapshots and deterministic tie-break rules.
- **Civic cost model:** **Voting is fee-less**; introduced **Civic Gas Pool** and **non-transferable Voting Credits** for anti-spam and accessibility.
- **Attestations & minting:** Evidence tiers, challenge windows, geographic normalization; reputation (STAR/FLAME) influences attestations only, never rights.
- **Security & bootstrap:** No premine; validator operational bonds; public genesis ceremony; verifier CLI requirements and public mock-election readiness path.

---

## Abstract

Essentia is a post-quantum secure **civic ledger** providing (1) **self-sovereign identity** via a native DID method, (2) **verifiable governance** with private ballots and public proofs, (3) **attestation rails** for real-world contributions, and (4) **value rails** comprising a transferable token (**Essent, ‚Ñ∞**) and a non-transferable, expiring instrument for essentials (**Essential Unit, ùí∞**) used to deliver an inflation-aware **Freedom Floor (UBI)**.

Minting of ‚Ñ∞ follows **proof-of-contribution** attested by elected **Attestors** and weighted by a **Web-of-Trust** reputation model (**STAR/FLAME**). ùí∞ issuance is policy-driven and separate from ‚Ñ∞ supply. Rights (vote, UBI, due process) are never reputation-gated. Ballots are private; outcomes are independently verifiable.

---

## 1. Purpose & Motivation

1. **Civic spine:** Neutral, verifiable rails for identity, voting, attestation, and Freedom-Floor disbursement.
2. **Freedom with compassion:** Material security enables education-first safety systems.
3. **Proof over authority:** Mint ‚Ñ∞ for _validated_ positive contribution with publicly verifiable evidence.
4. **Dignity constraint:** Reputation tunes _influence_, not _rights_.

## 3. Identity & Credentials

### 3.1 DID Method

- **Method:** `did:essentia:<multibase>`. DID Document exposes:  
  **Authentication** (WebAuthn/Passkeys ‚Äî Ed25519), **Assertion/Spend** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium-3), optional **Key Agreement** (hybrid).
- **Rotation & Recovery:** Signed updates; social recovery with 3‚Äì5 guardians or hardware escrow; on-chain hash anchoring.
- **Privacy:** DID Docs contain no PII; claims exist as verifiable credentials (VCs) off-chain.

### 3.2 Verifiable Credentials

- **Proof-of-Personhood (PoP):** one-to-one person‚ÜîDID assurance via privacy-preserving ceremony.
- **Role Credentials:** Attestor, Steward, Validator.
- **Learning/Competency:** Academy badges (e.g., UPE Core, Mediator 101).
- **Selective Disclosure:** BBS+ signatures and ZK predicates reveal only necessary attributes.
- **Anchoring:** Issuance/revocation hashes recorded on-chain.

---

## 4. Governance

### 4.1 Mechanisms

- **Ballot privacy & verifiability:** Elections specify either **Commit‚ÄìReveal** (commitment $C=H(vote, salt)$, later reveal) or **MACI-style encrypted ballots**. Receipt-free mode is offered. On-chain artifacts include proposal hash, ballot commitments or encrypted payloads, and a result digest with proofs.
- **Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV):** Single-winner uses instant-runoff; multi-winner uses Droop quota. Tie-break seed = $H(\text{proposalId}\,\|\,\text{snapshotHeight})$. Exhausted ballots do not transfer further.
- **Revocable Delegation (domain-scoped):** Delegations form a directed acyclic graph per domain; cycles are resolved by removing the newest edge. A direct vote overrides delegation for that proposal.
- **Quadratic Voting (QV) ‚Äî budgeting only:** Each voter receives a fixed, non-transferable credit budget $B$. Casting $k$ votes on an option costs $k^2$. Credits expire at round end and are not tradable.
- **Quorum & thresholds:** Network-wide constitutional measures require **two-of-three** supermajorities across the **Assembly of Members**, relevant **Steward Circle**, and **Validator Commons**. Operational items: Steward Circle + Assembly simple majority with quorum ‚â• max(1% of eligible, 500).
- **Timing windows:** Commit open/close and reveal open/close (or MACI equivalents) are declared per election with grace periods. Eligibility snapshot height $h_s$ is stored in the proposal object.

### 4.2 Auditability

Publish canonical JSON artifacts: (i) ballot commitments/encrypted payloads, (ii) RCV round tables, (iii) delegation resolution trace, (iv) result digest and proof hashes. A **Verifier CLI** recomputes eligibility at $h_s$, replays RCV rounds, resolves delegations, validates proofs, and emits a canonical results file.

### 4.3 Civic Cost Model

- **Fee-less participation:** Submitting commitments, reveals, delegation changes, or QV allocations requires no ‚Ñ∞ or ùí∞ balances.
- **Civic Gas Pool (CGP):** Treasury-funded pool covers chain costs of election transactions. Budgets are approved per epoch; unspent funds roll forward.
- **Voting Credits (VCRED):** Per-election, non-transferable credits entitle each eligible voter to a bounded number of ballot operations (e.g., one commit, one optional update, one reveal). VCRED are free and expire when the election ends.
- **Rate-limits & relays:** DID-scoped API rate-limits and commitment size caps deter spam. Official relayers accept ballots over multiple transports (web, Tor, low-bandwidth endpoints) and are reimbursed from CGP; envelopes are publicly auditable.  
  VCRED cover **updates** as well as initial commits/reveals; all such transactions are reimbursed from the CGP.

### 4.4 Vote Updates (Amendments)

- **Commit‚ÄìReveal:** Each voter submits commitments with a strictly increasing sequence number `seq`. Only the **highest-seq** commitment that is subsequently **revealed** within the reveal window is counted; earlier commitments are ignored.  
  `commit = H(proposalId ‚à• snapshotHeight ‚à• seq ‚à• encodedVote ‚à• salt)`. Reveals must include the matching `(seq, encodedVote, salt)`. Sequence reuse is invalid.
- **MACI-style:** A voter may submit update messages; the **last valid** message before close supersedes prior ones. The tally proves in zero knowledge that exactly one final vote per eligible voter was applied.
- **Delegation precedence:** A direct vote for a proposal overrides any delegation for that proposal; submitting a new direct vote replaces the previous one.
- **Abuse resistance:** VCRED bound the number of ballot operations; DID-scoped rate-limits may apply.

## 5. Contribution, Attestation & Minting

### 5.1 Evidence Tiers

Quests select an **evidence tier (ET)** that caps impact: **ET-1** (media + location), **ET-2** (third-party QC or peer review), **ET-3** (replication/audited impact). Higher tiers permit higher impact caps; higher penalty for falsehood.

### 5.2 Attestation Flow

1. **Submission:** Executor stores evidence off-chain; posts content hash + metadata on-chain.
2. **Review:** At least _m_ Attestors verify and co-sign an attestation leaf.
3. **Aggregation:** Merkle root $R = H(\pi \parallel \sigma_1 ‚Ä¶ \sigma_m)$ recorded as **AttestationRef**.
4. **Challenge window:** Counter-evidence may reduce impact or apply FLAME to signers with restorative steps.
5. **Mint:** Valid submissions mint ‚Ñ∞ via ¬ß5.3.

### 5.3 Minting Function (‚Ñ∞)

Let _c_ be complexity, _i_ bounded impact (per ET), $\mathbf{s}$ the vector of Attestor STARs, and $I*{\max}$ the epoch cap:

$$
M = \min\!\left( c^{\alpha} \cdot i^{\beta} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_j s_j},\; I*{\max} \right),
\quad \alpha,\beta\in(0,1)
$$

Defaults: $\alpha=0.6,\ \beta=0.4$. Impact components are geographically normalized.

### 5.4 Reputation Dynamics

$$
\mathrm{STAR}_t(v) = \gamma \!\!\sum_{(u\to v, w, \tau=+) \in E_t}\!\! w\cdot \mathrm{STAR}*{t-1}(u)\cdot (1-\mathrm{FLAME}_{t-1}(u)),
\quad \gamma\in(0,1)
$$

$$
\mathrm{FLAME}\_t(v)=\mathrm{FLAME}_{t-1}(v)\, e^{-\lambda \Delta t}
$$

(half-life ‚âà 90 days). Reputation influences attestations and surfacing only.

## 6. Value & Monetary Policy

### 6.1 Instruments

- **Essent (‚Ñ∞):** Transferable, fungible; for exchange, grants, staking bonds, and fees.
- **Essential Unit (ùí∞):** Non-transferable, spend-restricted to essentials, expiring; the UBI rail.

### 6.2 Supply Streams

- **Contribution mint (‚Ñ∞):** Bounded by per-epoch cap $I\_{\max}$.
- **UBI issuance (ùí∞):** Separate contract; not counted against ‚Ñ∞ cap.
- **Grants:** Treasury disbursements in ‚Ñ∞ or ùí∞.

### 6.3 Inflation & Indexing

$$
\Delta S*{\mathcal{E}} \le S*{\text{prev}}\cdot \rho,\quad \rho \in [2\%,5\%]\ \text{annualized}
$$

ùí∞ auto-indexes quarterly to an **Essentials CPI** via a medianized oracle; bounded governance veto/raise. ùí∞ expiration dampens hoarding.

### 6.4 Treasury & Reserves

Multi-sig treasury with on-chain policy; quarterly disclosures. Optional buffers for smoothing; triggers are published.

---

## 7. Ledger & Consensus

### 7.1 Data Model

On-chain: DID anchors, VC issuance/revocation hashes, AttestationRefs, proposal refs, ballot commitments, ùí∞ epoch parameters, ‚Ñ∞ UTXOs.  
Off-chain: evidence bundles (content-addressed); replicated gateways with integrity checks.

### 7.2 Consensus

Narwhal/Bullshark-style DAG mempool and **HotStuff BFT** finality. Validators are public DIDs posting **operational bonds** (slashed for downtime/double-sign). No premine.

### 7.3 Keys & Signatures

Authentication: **Ed25519** (passkeys). Spend/blocks: **CRYSTALS-Dilithium-3**. VC selective disclosure: **BBS+**; ZK predicates for attributes. Hashing: Poseidon/Blake3 (domain-separated). Ballot privacy: Commit‚ÄìReveal or MACI-style with coordinator proofs.

---

## 8. Voting Privacy & Verification

Ballots are unlinkable to identities; receipt-free mode is available. Published artifacts include encrypted/committed ballots, RCV round tables, delegation traces, result digests, and proof hashes. The **Essentia Verifier CLI** reconstructs eligibility at snapshot, resolves delegation, replays RCV rounds, validates proofs, and emits canonical results.

**Minting function.**  
$M = \min!\left( c^{\alpha} \cdot i^{\beta} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{j} s_{j}},, I_{\max} \right)$.

**Supply cap.**  
$\Delta S*{\mathcal{E}} \le S*{\text{prev}} \cdot \rho $.

**Reputation dynamics.**  
$\mathrm{STAR}t(v) = \gamma \sum{(u\to v,, w,, \tau=+) \in E_t} w \cdot \mathrm{STAR}{t-1}(u) \cdot \bigl(1-\mathrm{FLAME}{t-1}(u)\bigr)$.  
$\mathrm{FLAME}\_t(v)=\mathrm{FLAME}\_{t-1}(v)\, e^{-\lambda \Delta t}$.

---

## 14. Formal Notation (Extract)

Graph $G=(V,E,W,T)$ with $W:E\to[-1,1]$, $T$ edge types.  
STAR diffusion $\mathrm{STAR}=(I-\gamma A)^{-1} b $, weighted adjacency $A$, base vector $b$.  
FLAME decay $\mathrm{FLAME}(t)=\mathrm{FLAME}(t_0), e^{-\lambda (t-t_0)}$.  
‚Ñ∞ mint cap $\Delta S_{\mathcal{E}} \le S_{\text{prev}},\rho$.  
RCV uses deterministic tie-break seed $H(\text{proposalId}\,\|\,\text{snapshotHeight})$.

---

## 15. Charter Compliance (Traceability)

Rights not reputation-gated; ballots private with public proofs; education-issued VCs unlock stewardship utility (not rights); transparent budgets and ‚ÄúWhat Changed‚Äù logs; privacy by default with selective disclosure.

---
